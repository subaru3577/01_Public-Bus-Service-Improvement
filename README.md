**Overview:**  
  
This work sheds light on the disparity in school travel between urban and rural areas. Students in rural areas often experience more extended school travel and unfavourable walking conditions due to inadequate pavement and road safety concerns. Given the budgetary constraints of the local governments, one potential policy is to enhance public transport services and utilise them for school trips. 
This work aims to address the issue by identifying the areas with higher priority for enhancing school travel environments through enhancing public transport services.
